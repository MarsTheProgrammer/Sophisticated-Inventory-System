# Sophisticated Inventory System
Inventory system made for a fictional manufacturing plant. There are parts and products. Each of which can be added, modified, and deleted. Products can have associated parts
that stay with the part. Both the parts and products can be searched by ID and name. All ID's are auto-generated.
